Proprietary Rights and Enforcement Notice for
NextEleven LLC Repositories
Effective Date: January 7, 2026
Issued by: NextEleven LLC, Frisco, Texas, USA
As Corporate Attorney for NextEleven LLC: This document serves as the binding legal
framework governing all intellectual property contained within any GitHub repositories
owned, maintained, o r controlled by NextEleven LLC (hereinafter "the Company"). This i s
not an open-source license. This is a zero-tolerance, all-encompassing proprietary
protection declaration designed t o annihilate any unauthorized interaction with our
creations. Every line o f code, every file, every commit, every idea, design, algorithm,
architecture, documentation, graphic, script, configuration, data structure, user interface
element, or any other tangible or intangible element (collectively, "the Works") is the
exclusive property o f NextEleven LLC. We will hunt down violators with unrelenting fury,
leveraging every legal avenue available under United States federal law, Texas state law,
international treaties, and the laws o f any jurisdiction where infringement occurs. There are
no loopholes. There is no mercy. Violation means war.
1. Absolute Ownership and Copyright Assertion
All Works in these repositories are protected by copyright under the United States
Copyright Act o f 1976 (as amended, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998
and subsequent updates through December 2025), the Berne Convention for the
Protection o f Literary and Artistic Works, the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) Copyright Treaty, and equivalent laws i n every country worldwide. Copyright ©
2026 NextEleven LLC. All rights reserved worldwide.
• N o Implied Rights: Nothing in these repositories grants any license, sublicense,
permission, or right-express, implied, statutory, o r otherwise—to view, access,
download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, display, transmit, o r otherwise use the
Works in any manner whatsoever without prior written authorization from an executive
officer o f NextEleven LLC.
• Automatic Protection: Protection attaches immediately upon creation, without need
for registration (though w e reserve the right t o register copyrights formally for
enhanced enforcement). As o f December 2025, U.S. copyright law provides for
statutory damages up t o $150,000 per willful infringement, and we will seek the
maximum in every case.
• Trade Secrets and Confidential Information: Any non-public elements, including but
not limited to source code, proprietary algorithms, business logic, or internal
documentation, are trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act o f 2016 (18
U.S.C. § 1839) and Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code § 134A). Misappropriation will trigger civil and criminal penalties,
including treble damages and attorneys' fees.
2. Prohibited Activities: A Comprehensive Blacklist
You are expressly forbidden from engaging i n any o f the following, directly o r indirectly,
anywhere i n the world:
• Copying o r Reproduction: Duplicating any part o f the Works, i n whole o r in part,
including but not limited to cloning repositories via Git, forking, mirroring, scraping,
screenshotting, photographing, or any other form of replication.
• Stealing or Misappropriation: Accessing, downloading, o r extracting the Works
without permission, including through automated tools, bots, APls, o r manual means.
This includes "inspiration" that results in substantially similar creations—we will pursue
derivative works a s infringements under 17 U.S.C. § 106.
• Cloning o r Forking: Creating any derivative, modified, o r adapted version o f the
Works, whether for personal, commercial, educational, o r any other use. Reverse
engineering, decompiling, disassembling, o r attempting t o derive source code is a
direct violation under the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions (17 U.S.C. § 1201),
punishable b y u p t o $500,000 in fines and 5 years imprisonment for first offenses.
• Distribution o r Sharing: Uploading, posting, emailing, linking, o r otherwise
disseminating the Works o r any portion thereof on any platform, including but not
limited t o other GitHub repos, GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge, personal websites,
social media, forums, cloud storage, or physical media.
• Public Performance o r Display: Demonstrating, showcasing, or integrating the Works
into any product, service, presentation, or public medium without explicit license.
• Commercial Exploitation: Using the Works i n any business, startup, app, software,
hardware, A l model training, o r revenue-generating activity. This includes indirect uses
like benchmarking or competitive analysis.
• Educational or Non-Profit Use: N o exemptions for "fair use" claims—we will contest
and litigate any asserted fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, demanding proof o f
transformative nature, minimal portion used, and no market harm (which we assert is
always present).
• A l and Machine Learning: Feeding any Works into A l systems for training, generation,
or analysis constitutes theft and will be pursued as copyright infringement, consistent
with emerging case law as o f December 2025 (e.g., extensions o f Getty Images v.
Stability Al precedents).
• International Violations: If you are outside the U.S., we invoke the Universal Copyright
Convention, TRIPS Agreement (under WTO), and bilateral treaties t o enforce in your
jurisdiction. We will use long-arm statutes (e.g., Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code § 17.042) t o haul you into Texas courts.
Any attempt t o circumvent these prohibitions, including through VPNs, proxies,
anonymous accounts, o r offshore entities, will be treated as willful infringement, escalating
damages.
3. Enforcement: Ruthless Pursuit and Maximum Damages
We d o not negotiate. We d o not settle lightly. Violation triggers immediate and aggressive
action:
• Cease and Desist: You will receive a demand to immediately cease all infringing
activities, delete all copies, and provide a sworn affidavit o f compliance.
• Litigation: We will file suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District o f Texas
(Frisco jurisdiction) or any appropriate international court. W e seek:
• Injunctive Relief: Permanent injunctions t o stop your activities, under 17 U.S.C. §
502.
• Damages: Actual damages, profits from infringement, statutory damages (up t o
$150,000 per work), treble damages for trade secret misappropriation, and
punitive damages where available (e.g., under Texas law for willful conduct).
• Attorneys' Fees and Costs: Full recovery under 17 U.S.C. § 505 and equivalent
laws.
• Criminal Prosecution: Referral t o the FBI, DOJ, or international authorities for
criminal copyright infringement (17 U.S.C. § 506, up t o 10 years imprisonment for
repeat offenders) o r trade secret theft (18 U.S.C. § 1832).
• Global Reach: Through mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and partnerships with
firms in Europe (GDPR-aligned enforcement), Asia (e.g., China's Anti-Unfair
Competition Law), and beyond, we will enforce judgments worldwide. Assets will b e
seized, domains frozen, and reputations destroyed.
• Monitoring and Detection: We employ automated tools, watermarking, digital
fingerprints, and third-party services to detect infringements. GitHub's DMCA
takedown process will b e invoked instantly (under 17 U.S.C. § 512), but we g o further-
suing platforms for contributory infringement i f they fail t o act.
• N o Statute of Limitations Escape: We will pursue claims within the three-year U.S.
copyright statute (17 U.S.C. § 507), but tolling applies for concealed infringements.
International claims follow local limits, extended by discovery rules.
